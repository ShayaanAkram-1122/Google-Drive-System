# Google-Drive-System



#This project is a terminal-based Google Drive simulation built in C++ without STL, featuring user registration, login, and password recovery with role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer). It allows users to create, navigate, and manage folders and files, including file versioning and a recycle bin. File sharing is handled using a graph-based permission system where each user is a node and sharing relationships are edges. Admins have full access, Editors can read/write, and Viewers can only read. All access is validated using custom data structures and hashed security credentials, offering a simplified yet powerful model of a cloud storage system.
